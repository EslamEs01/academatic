Active feature: **Spec 020 — Family / Guardian Internal Pages** (next). **Spec 019 — Student Internal Pages
is IMPLEMENTED** (awaiting the watcher commit): six new page pairs `student-{schedule,homework,materials,
progress,history,profile}(.en).html` (51→**63** built; **49/63 hash-identical**) · six `ROLE_NAV.student`
flips `planned→implemented` · the home quick-tiles honesty fix (implemented tiles are REAL links; home body
anchors 0→6) · ONE shared primitives component `components/portal-page.js` · the `build-html.mjs` touch =
6 imports + 6 entries + the line-132 `activeId` pass-through (byte-neutral for all 51 pre-existing files —
proven) · ceiling extended to internals [500,2200] · smoke 62 loads green · axe 0/0 · payHit/zero-pay/family/
teacher/hub/family-child/admin asserts held BYTE-VERBATIM. The pattern for Specs 020/021: flip the role's
registry statuses + ship the page pairs + make that home's quick-tiles status-aware; the shell never changes.

For decisions, contracts, and acceptance read the delivered plan and its artifacts:
`academy-dashboard-discovery/specs/019-student-internal-pages/plan.md`
(see also `research.md` (D1–D16), `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `visual-grounding.md`, and `contracts/` — 15 contracts).

History: **Spec 018** (commit `fe47f68`) delivered the COMPACT admin-like role homes (5 bands each,
≈1,428/1,753/1,486px @1366×768, down from ≈3,600/4,200/4,390; ceiling smoke-pinned) + the NEW
`family-child(.en).html` drill-down (five baked fam1 panels st1/st6/st11/st12/st13, pure-CSS `#child=stX`
`:target` switching, family home bodyAnchors===5); identity 43/51; displaced 013/014/015 fixtures/keys
RETAINED for 019–021. Spec 017 = `0edafe1` (Shell v2) · Spec 016 = `2b8bb84` (law).

**Spec 018 (the user's binding verdict)**: the three role HOMES are too long/portal-like → rework into
COMPACT admin-like dashboards inside the untouched Shell v2 — the 7-band recipe (compact header · 4-KPI
row (`num()` fixture literals) · now band (today ≤3 + next) · role-core (student homework snapshot ·
family CHILDREN CARDS w/ real drill-down links · teacher follow-up board) · ONE preview band · quick-link
tiles · one-line note), HARD CEILINGS smoke-asserted (sections 4–7 · scrollHeight ≤2,200px @1366×768,
±10% tunable-recorded) — the endless page can never return. **NEW `family-child(.en).html`** (the ONE
sanctioned build-html.mjs touch = 2 lines: import + PAGES entry): five BAKED child panels for the REAL
fam1 roster **st1/st6/st11/st12/st13**, existing data-tab/hash machinery, default st1, deep links
`#child=stX`; family home bodyAnchors 0→**5** exact child targets; the child page: shell registry
{family-portal, portals}×5, body 0, zero-pay regex applies. **Displacement map is law** — zero capability
deletion; displaced fixtures/keys RETAINED (grep-audited) for Specs 019–021. ONE sanctioned smoke
amendment re-scopes the 013/014/015 long-home branches (KPI===4 + window + ceiling; family anchors===5;
teacher anchors===1 KEPT) + adds the family-child branch (50 loads) — **payHit + family zero-pay regex +
ALL Shell-v2/hub/admin asserts BYTE-VERBATIM**. Identity target **43/51** (40 admin + index + hub pair;
built = 51 files). Teacher pay-free EXTENDED set re-runs all three layers. Sequence renumbered
(user-directed, append-only amendment to the 016 sequence artifact): **019 Student pages · 020 Family
pages · 021 Teacher pages · 022–027 admin groups · 028 Final QA**.

**Spec 016 is BINDING LAW for all Specs 017–027** (committed docs at
`…/specs/016-full-frontend-audit-role-dashboards-ia-design-freeze/`): the role-dashboard IA
(the three portals are Role Dashboard HOMES — kept filenames; full apps = mini-apps with role
sidebars), the design freeze (+ forbidden-pattern register + change control), the honesty/
backendRequired contract (four action classes, four gate patterns, the no-fake register), the
**teacher pay-free GLOBAL contract** (the entire `teacher-*` family forever), the legacy coverage
matrix (178 templates, zero uncategorized), the admin sidebar inventory (57 rows → Specs 021–026),
and the sequence 017–027 with Spec-027's eight machine-checkable no-missing rules.

History: Spec 017 (`0edafe1`) delivered **Portal Shell v2** — role topbar + desktop `aside.pt-sidenav`
(identity block · ROLE_NAV items · hub exit) + native mobile `details.pt-nav-drawer` (freeze amendments
A1 native-disclosure + A2 no-collapse) on the three role pages; ROLE_NAV registries (7/8/7, home=real
self-link `aria-current`, futures=planned «قريبًا» BUTTONS, zero new hooks/pages); all nav OUTSIDE
`#page-body` (home content proven byte-equal); sanctioned-anchor registries smoke-pinned (shell
{self,hub} multiset 5); 41/49 identity held. Spec 015 (`20dc089`) delivered the TEACHER home — 14 sections (real out15/out4 follow-ups,
5-step workflow + A2 gate notes «تسجيل الغياب…»/«طلب إلغاء أو تعويض…», recent-sessions slice out1/out11,
SAT/MON/TUE day-groups + truthful free-days empty, rubric lines, ONE sanctioned body anchor →
`teacher-performance(.en).html`), planned register {outcomeSave/matUpload/availabilityEdit:
backendRequired, taskManage: planned}, three-layer pay-free enforcement; coverage §9 (27 T-rows).
Spec 014 (`0d144aa`): FAMILY home — 12 sections, zero-pay regex, PORTAL_PLANNED.family 2+2;
coverage §8. Spec 013 (`86729a9`): STUDENT home — 13 sections, gauges, PORTAL_PLANNED.student 2+1;
coverage §7. Spec 012 (`5bcf490`): portal layer + hub + `ar,en.prt.js` overlay + payHit assert +
the 39-page legacy coverage artifact. Spec 011 (`e7ee011`): zero `href="#"` STANDING. Spec 010
(`0ee1965`): coverage matrix/nav IA/chip-tone guard. Prior plans under `…/specs/0NN-*/plan.md`.

Hard constraints (Specs 001–016, all carried + binding): the ADMIN console continues the approved
design (six-category rail); **static HTML-first** — complete pre-rendered `public/*.html` per
language, NO whole-page `#app`, all content baked at build, enhancement only via the CLOSED
`data-*` hook set — NO new hook, NO new storage key; relative paths; GitHub-Pages compatible;
Django-template-ready; Arabic RTL first + English LTR; Light/Dark/System; ALL status/signal chips
labeled icon+text; native JS; no CDN/TypeScript/SPA/chart/table/form/calendar libs; fixtures only —
no real API/auth/permissions/CRUD/persistence; NO engine of any kind; NO computed
score/rank/leaderboard/percentile/chart; ALL salary/payroll/compensation/payout math OUT of scope —
zero pay figures anywhere; reports body finance-free FOREVER; finance body Spec 009-invariant; zero
`href="#"` sitewide; no copied legacy assets/classes/palette/wording/status codes; screenshot-based
visual acceptance. **Portal rules (Specs 012–017, standing)**: role apps are a SEPARATE surface —
never the admin shell, never in admin nav; personas = st1/fam1/sara until real auth
(backendRequired); every number authored; every action one of the four honest classes; planned nav
items are labeled non-links, never anchors; the sanctioned-anchor registry pins every portal page's
link inventory; the family app carries ZERO currency/pay figures; **the teacher app is PAY-FREE
GLOBALLY** (extended token set incl. أتعاب/فلوس/دولار/money/currency, copy AND comments, no route to
any pay surface — three-layer enforced). Future: 018 student pages · 019 family pages · 020 teacher
pages · 021–026 admin families per the 016 sidebar inventory · 027 final no-missing QA.
